<div class="site_desc">
<p>&#8594; Translated to "Land of Kings," Rajasthan brims with remnants of the kings and queens of past centuries. Between its <strong>glittering palaces</strong>, <strong>stately forts, </strong>and <strong>lively festivals, </strong>this western state deserves a starring role in your trip to India. </p>
<p><br><strong>&#8594; Jaipur</strong>, part of the <strong>Golden Triangle Tourist Circuit,</strong> which also includes <strong>Agra </strong>and <strong>New Delhi, </strong>is one of the top places to visit in Rajasthan. Dubbed "The Paris of India," it's known for its characteristic pink buildings, lavish City Palace, and jewelry stores galore. </p>
<p><br>&#8594; The <strong>"Blue City," Jodhpur</strong>, offers tourists an equally unforgettable experience in its hilltop <strong>Mehrangarh Fort</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Udaipur </strong>oozes romance with its flower-lined streets and fantastic <strong>City Palace Complex</strong>, where the royal family still lives today. </p>

<h1 class="sitename" style="color: #F16262 ;"">5. Rishikesh </h1>

<div class="site_desc">
<p>&#8594; Rishikesh has been on the radar for spiritually minded travelers since the late 1960s, when the Beatles spent time in <strong>Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram</strong>&ndash;now an abandoned site that has become an off-the-beaten-path tourist attraction for fans. </p>
<p><br>&#8594; The town is nestled in the foothills of the <strong>Himalayas </strong>on the banks of the holy <strong>Ganges River, </strong>and serves as a center for <strong>yoga </strong>and <strong>pilgrimages</strong>. Take part in the action, or just enjoy the sounds of the temple bells and sightseeing from Rishikesh's <strong>two suspension bridges</strong>, often guarded by assertive families of <strong>monkeys. </strong>Keep your distance. </p><br><br>

<h1 class="sitename" style="color: #EF05EF ;">6. Varanasi </h1>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><center><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2019/11/india-best-places-to-visit-varanasi.jpg" width="730" height="467"/><figcaption><b>(A holy person on the Ganges River in Varanasi)</b></figcaption></center></figure></p>
<div class="site_desc">
<p>&#8594; One of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world, Varanasi is arguably the holiest place in India. The spiritual activities take place along the sacred <strong>Ganges River, </strong>where pilgrims bathe and mourners cremate recently deceased relatives in plain view of passersby. </p>
<p><br>&#8594; Tourists, on the other hand, find their own flavor of spiritualism taking <strong>sunrise boat rides, </strong>releasing <strong>floral blessings </strong>that float on the river, and watching the fire-filled <strong>Hindu chanting ceremonies </strong>from the steep ghats. </p>
<p><br>&#8594; Away from the water, the streets of the old town twist and turn like an endless maze. Legend has it that there's still no accurate map of Varanasi, and once you experience the labyrinthine city for yourself, you'll be inclined to believe it. </p><br><br>

<h1 class="sitename" style="color: #71E5B9  ;">7. Goa</h1>

<div class="site_desc">
<p>&#8594; India's not just full of big cities and holy sites&ndash;it also has <strong>incredible beaches</strong> down south in Goa. Its stretches of <strong>golden sand</strong> along the <strong>Arabian Sea </strong>offer something for every type of tourist, whether you're interested in hanging out with the backpacker crowd in <strong>laid-back beach huts</strong> or having a <strong>ritzy tropical getaway</strong> at a <strong>five-star resort. </strong></p>
<p><br>&#8594; One unique part of Goa is its blend of Indian and Portuguese cultures. You'll experience the fusion throughout the destination, from its <strong>Baroque architecture </strong>and <strong>cathedrals</strong> to its spicy <strong>vindaloo curries</strong> and <strong>seafood dishes. </strong></p><br><br>

<div class="site_desc">
<p>&#8594; Head south of Goa, and you'll trade beaches for tranquil backwaters in Kerala. Nothing beats the experience of hopping aboard a <strong>traditional thatched-top houseboat</strong> in <strong>Alleppey </strong>(also known as <strong>Alappuzha</strong>) and slowly floating through <strong>palm-fringed lagoons and rivers, </strong>either as a day trip or overnight adventure. You'll enjoy <strong>freshly cooked Indian cuisine </strong>on the water and breathtakingly beautiful natural sights and wildlife. </p>
<p><br>&#8594; Easygoing Kerala is like a breath of fresh air from the intensity of cities like <strong>New Delhi </strong>and <strong>Jaipur </strong>up north. Schedule some time here when you're in need of a break from the chaos.  </p><br><br>

<div class="site_desc">
<p>&#8594; Time travel isn't a reality for travelers quite yet, but you can get pretty close at the Ajanta and Ellora Caves in <strong>Maharashtra. </strong>Both <strong>UNESCO World Heritage Sites</strong>, the caves feature intricate carvings from at least 1,500 years ago. </p>
<p><br>&#8594; The <strong>Ajanta Caves</strong> are the oldest of the two attractions, featuring around <strong>30 Buddhist cave monuments</strong> cut into the rock as far back as the 2nd century BC. </p>
<p><br>&#8594; Around 100 kilometers southwest, the <strong>Ellora Caves</strong> contain nearly three dozen Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu carvings, the most famous of which is the <strong>Kailasa Temple</strong> (Cave 16), a massive structure devoted to Lord Shiva that features <strong>life-size elephant sculptures</strong>. The magnificent carvings at both sites will leave you filled with wonder. </p><br><br>

<div class="site_desc">
<p>&#8594; The largest city in <strong>Gujarat</strong>, Ahmedabad is a noisy, overwhelming metropolis that somehow wins over the tourists who make their way here.

<p><br>&#8594; On the western bank of the <strong>Sabarmati River</strong>, tourists can wander around <strong>Sabarmati Ashram</strong>, Gandhi's headquarters from 1917 to 1930. Its museum talks about the life of the Indian hero, and displays his iconic <strong>spectacles </strong>and <strong>spinning wheel. </strong>While you're in the city, sample the<strong> street food</strong>&ndash;some say it's the best in all of India.
